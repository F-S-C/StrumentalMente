## Preface

This project represent an application of the Alessi & Trollip model (as already stated).

The goal of the system is to help the user knowing the sweet art of music. Therefore, the application contains some functions that can be used to learn the basics of the theory behind music, alongside with the basic use techniques of various musical instruments. While reaching its goals, the system gives the user the means to self-evaluate his knowledge, without ruining their use experience.
